This project provides a pipeline for soil image classification using a DINOv2 Vision Transformer backbone for feature extraction and a One-Class SVM for anomaly-based soil detection. The solution is designed for Kaggle-style competitions and outputs a submission-ready CSV.

Features
Modern Vision Backbone: Uses DINOv2 (ViT) via timm for robust feature extraction.

Unsupervised Outlier Detection: Employs One-Class SVM to distinguish soil from non-soil images.

Efficient Pipeline: Handles data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, prediction, and submission file generation.

Metrics Calculation: Easily extendable to compute accuracy, precision, recall, F1, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC if ground-truth labels are available.

Usage
Install Requirements

bash
pip install torch torchvision timm scikit-learn pandas numpy pillow tqdm
Prepare Data

Place train_labels.csv, train/, test.csv, and test/ in the soil_competition-2025/ directory.

Run the Classifier

bash
python soil_classifier_dinov2.py
Submission

The script generates submission.csv in the correct Kaggle format.

Metrics (Optional)

If you have ground-truth test labels (test_labels.csv), add the metrics code block (provided in responses above) to evaluate your predictions.

Pipeline Overview
Load DINOv2 Model:
Loads a pretrained DINOv2 Vision Transformer and removes the classification head to use as a feature extractor.

Image Preprocessing:
Resizes images to 224x224, normalizes, and converts to tensors.

Custom Dataset Loader:
Efficiently loads images and IDs for both training and testing.

Feature Extraction:
Extracts high-dimensional embeddings for all images.

One-Class SVM Training:
Trains on soil images to detect outliers (non-soil).

Prediction:
Predicts soil presence in test images (1 for soil, 0 for not soil).

Submission File Generation:
Outputs a CSV file ready for Kaggle submission.

Example: Metrics Calculation
If you have ground-truth test labels, you can compute all key metrics:

python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score, confusion_matrix, roc_auc_score
# ... (see previous assistant response for full code)
Notes
The default SVM configuration (nu=0.05) assumes at least 95% of the training data are inliers (soil).

For best results, ensure your training data is clean and representative.

For competitions, only submit the generated submission.csv unless otherwise instructed.
